# MATH3320-project

This is the project of MATH3320 in the 2022-2023 1st semester: Image classification based on CNN network This project is based on the dataset fashion-mnist.

Our project aims to provides basic deep learning background for readers to gain a brief overview of deep neural network. Topic includes the neural network architecture, Multilayer Perceptron, backpropagation, activation functions, CNN architecture, convolution, pooling, flattening, dropout, stochastic gradient descent. A working example for image classification on Fashion MNIST dataset using CNN is also illustrated in the end to provide an insight on how neural networks really works.
